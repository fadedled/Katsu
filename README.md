**Katsu** is a light cross-platform C library for 2D video game programming. It 
includes an API for 2D rendering, a simple input system, and sound output. 
Tile renderers of old school computers and video game consoles are the basis 
for Katsu's 2D rendering capabilities.


## Features

+ 4bpp 8x8 pixel tile format
+ 128 Color palettes, 16 colors each
+ 16 64x64 tilemaps
+ Affine transformations for tilemaps and sprite
+ Horizontal line effects
+ Window effects
+ Other old-school effects (Mosaic, palette manipulation, etc.)


## Build from source

Katsu is meant to be used as a static library since it's so small, to build Katsu and it's tools (these will be placed in the ```tools``` folder) from source do the following:

### Windows

If you are using Visual Studio you must set up the Visual Studio enviroment variables (this can be done in Windows Terminal by selecting the VS enviroment in the arrow dropdown menu). Then just run the ```build_win.bat``` batch file, this creates the static library ```lib/Katsu.lib```.

### Linux

Run the ```make``` command, this will generate the static library ```lib/libkatsu.a```.

## Installing Katsu for your project

Simply copy the static library to your project's ```lib``` folder, you must also copy the ```include/katsu``` to your project's ```include``` folder.


## Using and compiling your project

The following is a very basic example for creating a window and controlling the back color with the directional pad and the A button:

```c
#include <katsu/kt.h>

int main() {
    KTColor bcolor = {0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00};
    /* Init Katsu */
    if (kt_Init()) {
        return 0;
    }
    /* Loop forever */
    while (1) {
        kt_Poll();  /* Poll joypads and window events */
        /* Get the held buttons of the first joypad */
        u32 btns = kt_JoyButtonHeld(0);
        /* Use the bits to modify the R and B components */
        bcolor.r += ((btns >> JOY_BIT_RIGHT) & 0x1) - ((btns >> JOY_BIT_LEFT) & 0x1);
        bcolor.b += ((btns >> JOY_BIT_DOWN) & 0x1) - ((btns >> JOY_BIT_UP) & 0x1);
        /* Swap G and B components of the back color if A is held */		
        if (btns & JOY_A) {
            kt_BackColor(bcolor);
        } else {
            KTColor bcolor_alt = {bcolor.r, bcolor.b, bcolor.g, 0};
            kt_BackColor(bcolor_alt);
        }
        kt_Draw();  /* Draw the image */
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling on Windows

You will need Visual Studios MSVC or MinGW installed, link with ```User32.lib```, ```Opengl32.lib``` and ```Katsu.lib```. If you are using the console/terminal you should set your environment to use MSVC. Then compile with:

```
$> cl -Tc <your_source_code> -I".\include" -link User32.lib Opengl32.lib Xinput.lib lib\Katsu.lib -OUT:mygame.exe
$> mygame.exe
```

### Compiling on Linux

Development packages for X11, OpenGL, and PulseAudio are needed when compiling your project. You can download them from your package manager as ```libx11-dev```, ```libgl1-mesa-dev``` and ```libpulse-dev``` for Debian-based distros or as ```libX11-devel```, ```mesa-libGL-devel``` and ```pulseaudio-libs-devel``` for RedHat-based distros. After they are installed, you can compile and run from the terminal with:

```
$> gcc <your_source_code> -o mygame -I./include -L./lib -lGL -lpthread -lpulse-simple -lX11 -lm -ldl -lkatsu
$> ./mygame
```

## Keyboard keys

All Katsu applications use the same 11 keys from the keyboard:

- The four arrow keys and Z, X, A, S, Q, W, D, E, Enter, and RightShift
- Press Esc to exit form full screen


## Documentation and Developer Manual

To compile the documentation you will need to have doxygen installed, then run, the generated HTML will be located in the new ```docs``` folder:
```
$> make docs
```

The Katsu Developer Manual is a work-in-progress, the current version can be found here:

[Katsu Developer Manual](./res/katsu_dev_man.pdf)

## Assets

Katsu asks for particular formats; if you want to create assets that follow these 
formats, you must make your own tools (though a Katsu asset builder is planned). For simple
tile generation, you can use the kt-image tool found inside the ```tools``` folder after
building Katsu, this tool can read most image files and generate Katsu's 4bpp paletted format.
There might exist some 4bpp tile editors out there tho.

For creating tilemaps, a simple file exporter for the Tiled 2D map editor can be found in ```tools/tiled-extension``` (see it's [readme](./tools/tiled-extension/README.md) for more information).
